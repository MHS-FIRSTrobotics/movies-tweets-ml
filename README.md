Need a way to  check if you should use "Insert Movie Here" based on Twitter? Check here!

# Goal
Lots of times, students want to do a fundraiser involving some form of entertainment, like a movie.
This allows the students to judge the effectiveness of that movie based on how well it is doing in Twitter.

# Example
One can see a demo app using this model at https://mustangrobotics.club/resources/programming/projects/movies-for-fundraising.html,
or use the demo.html file (if you use the demo here be sure to change the '/assets/php/project...' to somewhere that has a similiar API)

# Models
This was written in Azure ML, so pictures of the model are included (because Azure ML doesn't currently accept exporting the model for sharing)

- Predictive Web Services Model: a variation that allows Web apps to use this model
- Training Model: basic model that is used to train from a database
- Web Service Model: advanced model to be used for both predictive and retraining of the current model
